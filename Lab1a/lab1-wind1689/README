1.Running the following commands to show the testing result
	1) make clean
	2) make WERROR_CFLAGS=
	3) ./profsh -t script.sh

2.My program main idea
	1) Construct a linked list to store the commands;
	2) read the shell script to construct several token lists;
	3) Each token list can be recognized as different types of command;
	4) Base on the recognization, construct the command with that type;
	5) Put the command into the command node;
	4) When all the command nodes are linked, the whole command linked list is done;

3.My program limitation
	1) The size of token list is fixed, I can not use the checked_realloc function to resize the token list.
